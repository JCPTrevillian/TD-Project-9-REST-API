REST API 

In this two-part capstone Javascript full stack project (Units 9 and 10) I created a REST API using Express to provide a way to administer a school database. This database will be populated with information about users and courses after the required log-in so the API can create a new account
or retrieve information on an existing account. 

After login, users will be able to: 
1. Interact with the database to retrieve information on existing courses 
2. Update or delete existing courses 
3. Create new courses

The second half of this two-part project will be creating a front-end client that uses this REST API as part of a full stack JavaScript Application. 

To complete this back-end server project, I used my knowledge of Javascript, Node.js, Express, REST APIS, and Sequelize. To test my application, I used Postman. 


HOW TO RUN THIS APPLICATION: 
1. Download project, open terminal run NPM install 
2. To initialize database run: npm run seed 
3. Run npm start 
4. Test server: http://localhost:5000/
5. To end: Ctrl + C
